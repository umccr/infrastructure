# Elsa Test Data

This is just a CDK for mock data of the AGHA store bucket. The aim is for [`elsa-data`](https://github.com/umccr/elsa-data) to use this for testing before configuring the production AGHA data.

## Useful commands

This is just a temporary resource and when it is done this stack should be removed and `cdk destroy` is what you are looking for.

Else, standard CDK command (`cdk synth`, `cdk diff`, `cdk deploy`) would work to update this CDK stack.
